This is a client-side form validator build with vanilla JavaScript. It checks the required entries, the specific __length__ of entries, email and password match using regular expressions.

## Projects specifications

- Create a form UI using HTML and CSS
- Add an error message `<small></small>` under specific inputs
- __`displayError()`__ and __`displaySuccess()`__ for changing colors on inputs
- __`checkRequired()`__ to check if the inputs should be filled with value
- __`checkUsername()`__ to check if the username contains only valid characters and in range of 5, 30.
- __`checkEmail()`__ to check if the email contains only valid characters and in range 7, 254.
